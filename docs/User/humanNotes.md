- The feature checkllist need to be more clear, divided in big feature that can be completely and independently.
- The database architecture needs to be clear and written in the database.md file and in the LLM code of conduct.
- The LLM code of conduct must be short and clear and added in the global rules.
- the development plan could be added in the feature checklist, in order to have only one source of truth.
